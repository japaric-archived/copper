<!-- # Introduction -->

<!-- > **UPDATE (2016-11-15)** I'm currently re-purposing this book to be more like a -->
<!-- > reference about low level details of Rust programs for Cortex-M micros. Thus -->
<!-- > it's in a state of flux right now. If you are looking for a more beginner -->
<!-- > friendly text, check out the [Discovery] book. -->

<!-- [Discovery]: https://japaric.github.io/discovery -->

<!-- > **WARNING** This is a work in progress! It's incomplete and some -->
<!-- > chapters/sections are still in draft phase. -->

<!-- The goal of this book is to get you started in *microcontroller software -->
<!-- development*. We'll mainly cover *bare metal programming* (programming directly -->
<!-- *on* hardware, without OS abstractions/services) but I hope we'll tread into OS -->
<!-- development territory (e.g. schedulers) in the latter chapters. We'll use the -->
<!-- [Rust programming language] and ARM [Cortex-M] microcontrollers as a means to -->
<!-- that end. -->

<!-- [Cortex-M]: http://www.arm.com/products/processors/cortex-m/index.php?tab=Why+Cortex-M? -->
<!-- [Rust programming language]: https://www.rust-lang.org/ -->

<!-- > **TODO** What are microcontrollers? micros vs general purpose computers. What -->
<!-- > are the differences between programming a micro and programming a general -->
<!-- > purpose computer? etc. -- In other words, I'm going to assume you already know -->
<!-- > *why* you want to learn to program microcontrollers in the first place. :-) -->

<!-- (Hopefully) At the end of this book the reader will: -->

<!-- - Be able to program any (ARM Cortex-M) microcontroller that's supported by the -->
<!--   Rust compiler and is minimally/properly documented. -->

<!-- - Become familiar with the *peripherals* (functionality) commonly provided by -->
<!--   microcontrollers: analog/digital I/O, communication protocols, timers, etc. -->

<!-- - Be able to write drivers for these peripherals and be able to compose them -->
<!--   into applications. -->

<!-- - Know how to use existing (C) tooling to inspect, profile and debug the program -->
<!--   they wrote. -->

<!-- > **DISCLAIMER** I don't claim to be an authority on embedded software -->
<!-- > development and much less an authority on embedded software development *with -->
<!-- > Rust*. The abstractions, programming patterns and development methods I -->
<!-- > present here are probably *not* the best practices because we don't know yet -->
<!-- > what those look like in Rust! I hope this book will trigger more interest and -->
<!-- > discussion on this topic and *that* will hopefully lead to the development of -->
<!-- > best practices. -->
