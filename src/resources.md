<!-- ## Cortex-M -->

<!-- The ultimate source of information about this processor family is the [ARM info center][0]. -->

<!-- [0]: http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.set.cortexm/index.html -->

<!-- Some documents of interest: -->

<!-- - [Cortex-M0 Devices - Generic User Guide][0]. About the Cortex-M0 processor, its instruction set -->
<!--   and its peripherals. -->
<!-- - [Cortex-M0+ Devices - Generic User Guide][1]. Same as above but for the Cortex-M0+. -->
<!-- - [Cortex-M3 Devices - Generic User Guide][2]. Same as above but for the Cortex-M3. -->
<!-- - [Cortex-M4 Devices - Generic User Guide][3]. Same as above but for the Cortex-M4. -->
<!-- - [Cortex-M7 Devices - Generic User Guide][4]. Same as above but for the Cortex-M7. -->
<!-- - [Procedure Call Standard for the ARM Architecture][5]. About the machine registers, how -->
<!--   subroutines are called, how their parameters are passed and how their results are returned. -->
<!-- - [Lazy Stacking and Context Switching][6]. How the processor automatically decides when (not) to -->
<!--   save floating-point registers on the stack during interrupts. Important if implementing an OS, as -->
<!--   one should re-implement this functionality in their context switching logic to keep context -->
<!--   switching times small. -->

<!-- ## LM3S6965EVB -->

<!-- This is the evaluation board we'll emulate using QEMU. It contains an LM3S6965 microcontroller. The -->
<!-- most important bits of documentation related to this board are: -->

<!-- - The [Microcontroller data sheet][6]. It contains the register maps and the descriptions of all the -->
<!--   device peripherals. -->
<!-- - The [Evaluation Board User manual][7]. Description of the physical board. -->
